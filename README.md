# TriviaGame-


This project, which I quite enjoyed making, consists of a trivia game, and is designed to demonstrate the effective use of timers and intervals. This project was at its most difficult when designing the occasionally complex chain of intervals and clears that were necessary to make the app run smoothly.

I also researched hoew to add gifs to this project to make playing it more fun. There are also counters to display the wins and losses at the end of the game, encouraging those playing it to have fun guessing the right answers, each of which are foc ued around the history of computing and programming. You can play through it here https://nick-haer.github.io/TriviaGame/
